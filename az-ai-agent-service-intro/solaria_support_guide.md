## 5. Frequently Asked Questions

### Do solar panels work during winter?

Yes! Solar panels actually perform more efficiently in cooler temperatures. While there are fewer daylight hours in winter, modern panels can generate electricity even on cloudy days. Snow can temporarily reduce output, but it typically slides off or melts quickly. Our customers see an average of 65-75% of their summer production during winter months.

### Can I add more panels to my existing system?

In most cases, yes! System expansions depend on several factors:
- Available roof space or ground area
- Your electrical panel capacity
- Local utility interconnection limits
- Your current inverter's capacity

Contact our technical team for a free expansion assessment. We'll evaluate your existing system and provide options for increasing your solar capacity.

### What happens during a power outage?

**Standard Grid-Tied Systems:** Your solar panels automatically shut down during outages for safety reasons (to protect utility workers). Your home will not have power until the grid is restored.

**Battery Storage Systems:** If you have a Solaria battery backup system, essential circuits in your home will continue to operate during outages. Battery systems can typically power critical loads for 8-24 hours depending on usage.

**Interested in backup power?** Ask about our battery storage solutions that can keep your lights on even when the grid goes down.

### How often should I clean my solar panels?

In most climates, rain provides sufficient cleaning. However, you may need professional cleaning if you notice:
- Significant dust or pollen buildup
- Bird droppings or debris
- A noticeable drop in energy production

We recommend professional cleaning 1-2 times per year in dusty environments, or annually in moderate climates.

### What is net metering?

Net metering allows you to sell excess solar energy back to your utility company. When your panels produce more energy than you use, the excess flows to the grid and you receive credits on your bill. These credits offset energy you consume when your panels aren't producing (like at night).

### How long do solar panels last?

Solaria panels come with a 25-year performance warranty, but most panels continue producing energy well beyond that timeframe. You can expect your system to operate effectively for 30+ years with minimal maintenance.
